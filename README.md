This challenge was completed for an application for a software developer role with a business intelligence app company.
The goal was to extract and manipulate sales and staff cost data from the files "transactions" and "work_shifts" respectively using Python.
The two particularly tricky things were a) interpreting unstructured break-time data from the work shifts file and b) calculating the working time for each hour, as the break start and end times did not necessarily coincide with an hour start/end.
