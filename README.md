This challenge completed for a software developer role with a business intelligence app company.
The goal was to extract and manipulate sales and staff cost data from the files "transactions" and "work_shifts" respectively using Python.
The two tricky things were a) interpreting unstructured break-time data from the work shifts file and b) calculating the working time for each hour, since the break start and end times did not necessarily co-inside with hour start and end.
